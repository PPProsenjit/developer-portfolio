            <h3>Hi I'm Prosenjit</h3>
            <p>Since Adobe Flash was a complete innovation, alongside with CSS 1.0 and HTML 4.01 as standards of the
                current
                web I've been passionate about web.
                For over a decade I had many opportunities to work in a vast spectrum of web technologies what let me
                gather
                a significant amount of various experience. Working for companies and individuals around the globe I met
                and
                learnt from amazing and ambitious people.</p>
